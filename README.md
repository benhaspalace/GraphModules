# GraphModules

[![Release modules](https://github.com/benhaspalace/GraphModules/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/benhaspalace/GraphModules/actions/workflows/release.yml)

GraphModules is a public catalog of tested, versioned **Terraform modules for
Microsoft Graph**. It helps manage **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active
Directory, or Azure AD)** and **Microsoft 365** resources—including users,
groups, applications, service principals, and entitlement management—with
infrastructure as code through the
official [`microsoft/msgraph` Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/msgraph/latest/docs).

The repository provides two complementary module collections:

- **Generated Microsoft Graph modules** cover supported create, read, update,
  and delete lifecycles from the Microsoft Graph v1.0 and beta schemas. They
  provide typed Terraform variables, request shaping, stable outputs, endpoint
  documentation, and credential-free mock tests.
- **Curated Microsoft Graph modules** handle common directory and identity
  governance scenarios that benefit from reviewed lifecycle behavior, including
  group membership, application and service-principal relationships, catalogs,
  access packages, assignment policies, resource role scopes, and Conditional
  Access policies and named locations.

Pin a [published release](https://github.com/benhaspalace/GraphModules/releases)
to get an immutable module path and the exact metadata, provider versions, tests,
and checksums associated with it.

## Browse generated Microsoft Graph Terraform modules

Browse the **[Microsoft Graph v1.0 module catalog](modules/generated/v1.0/README.md)**
or the **[Microsoft Graph beta module catalog](modules/generated/beta/README.md)**.
The catalogs follow the service areas in the
[Microsoft Graph REST API reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true),
including Users, Groups, Applications, Identity and access, Mail, Calendars,
Teams, Files, Security, Devices, and other Microsoft 365 workloads.

Generated modules use this repository layout:

```text
modules/generated/<api-version>/<category>/<collection-path>/
```

Each endpoint appears once under its relevant service category. For example,
user messages appear under **Mail**, while group events appear under
**Calendars**. Category pages list the available Terraform modules and link each
one to its public Microsoft Graph resource documentation. Every module README
describes its inputs, outputs, Graph URL, lifecycle, permissions considerations,
schema limitations, import address, and offline test command.

Generation targets collection endpoints with a documented `POST` operation and
an item lifecycle that supports `GET`, `PATCH` or `PUT`, and `DELETE`. Actions,
functions, listing helpers, and unsupported transport patterns are outside this
generated CRUD subset. Review the endpoint README before use: Microsoft Graph
permissions, licensing, and tenant restrictions still apply.

Microsoft recommends v1.0 APIs for production applications. Microsoft Graph beta
APIs are previews and can change incompatibly; see Microsoft's
[versioning and support policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/versioning-and-support).

## Use the curated Microsoft Graph Terraform modules

The curated modules focus on Microsoft Entra ID directory objects, entitlement
management workflows, and Conditional Access:

| Microsoft Graph area | Resource or workflow | Terraform module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Users | `/users` | [`modules/curated/users`](modules/curated/users) |
| Groups | `/groups`, owners, and members | [`modules/curated/groups`](modules/curated/groups) |
| Applications | `/applications` | [`modules/curated/applications`](modules/curated/applications) |
| Applications | `/servicePrincipals` | [`modules/curated/service-principals`](modules/curated/service-principals) |
| Identity governance | Entitlement-management catalogs | [`modules/curated/identity-governance/entitlement-management/catalogs`](modules/curated/identity-governance/entitlement-management/catalogs) |
| Identity governance | Catalog resources | [`modules/curated/identity-governance/entitlement-management/catalogs/resources`](modules/curated/identity-governance/entitlement-management/catalogs/resources) |
| Identity governance | Access packages | [`modules/curated/identity-governance/entitlement-management/access-packages`](modules/curated/identity-governance/entitlement-management/access-packages) |
| Identity governance | Access-package resource role scopes | [`modules/curated/identity-governance/entitlement-management/access-packages/resource-role-scopes`](modules/curated/identity-governance/entitlement-management/access-packages/resource-role-scopes) |
| Identity governance | Assignment policies | [`modules/curated/identity-governance/entitlement-management/assignment-policies`](modules/curated/identity-governance/entitlement-management/assignment-policies) |
| Conditional Access | Policies, report-only by default, with mandatory break-glass exclusions | [`modules/curated/identity/conditional-access/policies`](modules/curated/identity/conditional-access/policies) |
| Conditional Access | IP named locations (IPv4 and IPv6) | [`modules/curated/identity/conditional-access/named-locations/ip-ranges`](modules/curated/identity/conditional-access/named-locations/ip-ranges) |
| Conditional Access | Country named locations | [`modules/curated/identity/conditional-access/named-locations/countries`](modules/curated/identity/conditional-access/named-locations/countries) |

Curated modules expose higher-level Terraform inputs and outputs while preserving
Microsoft Graph identifiers for composition. Their READMEs document required
permissions, lifecycle choices, relationship cleanup, and module-specific examples.

## Install a module from GitHub

Configure the Microsoft Graph provider in the calling root module, then use a
Git source with a release tag:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    msgraph = {
      source  = "microsoft/msgraph"
      version = ">= 0.4.0, < 1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "msgraph" {}

module "application" {
  source       = "git::https://github.com/benhaspalace/GraphModules.git//modules/generated/v1.0/applications/applications?ref=<release-tag>"
  display_name = "Example application"
}

module "engineering_group" {
  source           = "git::https://github.com/benhaspalace/GraphModules.git//modules/curated/groups?ref=<release-tag>"
  display_name     = "Engineering"
  mail_nickname    = "engineering"
  security_enabled = true
}
```

Each `graphmodules-*` release tag covers both generated catalogs and the curated
modules. Module sources take these forms:

```text
git::https://github.com/benhaspalace/GraphModules.git//modules/generated/<api-version>/<category>/<collection-path>?ref=<release-tag>
git::https://github.com/benhaspalace/GraphModules.git//modules/curated/<module-path>?ref=<release-tag>
```

`<api-version>` is `v1.0` or `beta`. `<category>/<collection-path>` is the
module's directory in the catalog, for example
`applications/applications/by-application-id/extension-properties`, not the Graph
URL path. `<module-path>` is the path after `modules/curated/` in the curated
module table above.

Replace `<release-tag>` with a `graphmodules-*` tag from
[Releases](https://github.com/benhaspalace/GraphModules/releases), then run
`terraform init`. HashiCorp documents the `git::` source, `//` subdirectory, and
`?ref=` tag syntax in
[Use modules in your configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/configuration).
The provider supports Azure CLI, managed identity, service principal, and OpenID
Connect authentication; choose the method described in the
[`microsoft/msgraph` provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/msgraph/latest/docs).

Each `graphmodules-*` release also attaches v1.0, beta, and curated archives. They
keep the `modules/generated/...` and `modules/curated/...` paths above and add
`LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and `release-manifest.json` at the archive root; that
manifest is the same file as the `release-manifest.json` release asset.
`sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` fails for every listed asset you did not download, so
to check only the files you downloaded, run
`sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS`. The earlier `graphform-*` release
uses a different layout, described in its release notes.

For evaluation and non-production use, `?ref=latest` follows new releases without
editing each source. The `latest` branch moves only forward, to the commit of the
GitHub Latest release, after the release workflow has verified that release. Every
`terraform init -upgrade` then accepts the newest release, including breaking
interface changes, so first read the "Breaking changes and migration" section of
each new release's notes, when present. Pin production configurations to a
`graphmodules-*` tag or a commit SHA.

The release job cannot move the branch when the commits it would add change
workflow files, because GitHub does not give the job's token workflow permission.
The daily verification then reports the drift, and a maintainer fast-forwards the
branch with `git push origin <sha>:refs/heads/latest`, where `<sha>` is the commit
of the Latest release.

## Module sources and provenance

The generated Terraform module interfaces come from public Microsoft sources:

- [Microsoft Graph metadata](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-metadata)
  supplies OpenAPI and EDMX definitions for the v1.0 and beta endpoints. Microsoft
  explains how metadata represents Graph entity types, properties, enums, and
  relationships in [Calling the Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/call-api#microsoft-graph-api-metadata).
- [Microsoft Graph documentation](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-docs-contrib)
  supplies the public API-reference navigation used to organize modules by service
  area and link them to resource documentation.
- The official [`msgraph_resource`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/msgraph/latest/docs/resources/resource)
  implements the underlying Terraform lifecycle against Microsoft Graph REST APIs.

Each release pins immutable upstream commit IDs, source URLs, SHA-256 hashes,
provider versions, dependency hashes, and the complete input fingerprint. Inspect
[`modules/generated/release-manifest.json`](modules/generated/release-manifest.json)
or download the release's `release-manifest.json` asset to audit those inputs.
The catalogs do not fetch schemas or documentation during `terraform init`, plan,
or apply.

## Testing and release integrity

GitHub Actions run only on `main`. An update to the publication manifest pushed
to `main` by the release publisher App starts release verification using the tag
recorded in that commit. Every other push to `main` also starts a release
workflow run: its jobs are skipped when the release publisher App did not push it,
and a publisher push that leaves the manifest unchanged runs only the read-only
manifest check. A skipped job reports success, so the status badge above can show
a skipped run after a human merge. Filter the workflow's runs by the release
publisher App to see the last publication. Existing tags can also be verified or released by
manually dispatching the release workflow on `main`. Tag pushes and pull requests
do not start workflows.

Every published catalog passes the following automated checks before its release
tag is created:

1. Source manifests and cached metadata are checked against their recorded
   revisions and SHA-256 hashes.
2. Python regression tests cover schema reconciliation, type generation,
   classification, deterministic output, safe archive handling, and atomic
   publication behavior.
3. `terraform fmt -check`, `terraform init -backend=false`, and
   `terraform validate` run for every generated module and every curated module
   against the exact provider versions recorded in the release manifest.
4. Credential-free `terraform test` suites use provider mocks to check Graph URL
   construction, typed request bodies, omission of null optional properties,
   validation failures, and curated relationship behavior without contacting a
   Microsoft Graph tenant.
5. The GraphModules release workflow rebuilds the v1.0, beta, and curated archives
   from the tagged commit and requires their byte-level SHA-256 checksums to match
   the already tested artifacts before publishing the GitHub Release.

A daily scheduled workflow rebuilds every published release the same way and fails
if its tag commit or any asset's SHA-256 digest no longer matches the GitHub Release,
or if the `latest` branch points anywhere other than the GitHub Latest release.

Mock tests and schema validation do not prove that a caller has the required
Microsoft Graph permissions, license, or tenant configuration. Endpoint READMEs
link to the public API documentation for those deployment requirements. Live-tenant
integration checks are separate and opt-in; generated modules do not claim live
tenant coverage merely because their offline tests pass.

Each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/benhaspalace/GraphModules/releases)
contains:

- `graphmodules-v1.0-modules.tar.gz`
- `graphmodules-beta-modules.tar.gz`
- `graphmodules-curated-modules.tar.gz`
- `release-manifest.json`
- `interface-changes.json`
- `SHA256SUMS`

`interface-changes.json` lists the exact interface changes that each release
decision accepted, while the release notes summarize them with counts per kind.
Verify it with the other downloads using `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`; releases
published before this asset was introduced do not have it.
